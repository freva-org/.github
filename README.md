# 🌐 Freva - Free Evaluation System Framework
Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Freva**, the **Free Evaluation System Framework** — a powerful, modular, and open-source platform designed to unify **data access**, **analysis tools**, and **reproducible workflows** for Earth system science and beyond.

## 🌍 What is Freva?

Freva is a community-driven software framework originally developed for the atmospheric and climate science communities. It provides:

- **Unified data access** across distributed storage systems and institutions
- A **plugin system** to integrate custom analysis tools
- **Provenance tracking** to ensure fully reproducible scientific workflows
- **Multiple interfaces**: Command-line, REST API, and Web UI
- Support for **HPC environments**, **Docker/Podman**, and **Kubernetes**

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you want to try out Freva locally, install our deployment tool and spin up an instance with just a few commands:
